If grace is a kingdom I've stopped at the gate Thinking I don't deserve to pass through after all of the mistakes I've made  But I heard a whisper  As Heaven bent down Said, “Child, don't you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown?”   Now I'm just a beggar in the presence of a King I wish I could bring You so much more But if it's true You use broken things Then here I am Lord, I am all Yours   The pages of history they tell me it's true  That it's never the perfect; it's always the ones with the scars that You use It's the rebels and the prodigals; it's the humble and the weak  The misfit heroes You chose  Tell me there's hope for sinners like me   Grace is a kingdom  With gates open wide  There's seat at the table just waiting for you So, come on inside
