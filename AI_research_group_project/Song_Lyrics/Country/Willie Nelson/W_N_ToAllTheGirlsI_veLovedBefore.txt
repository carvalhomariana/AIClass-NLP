To all the girls I've loved beforeWho traveled in and out my doorI'm glad they came alongI dedicate this songTo all the girls I've loved beforeTo all the girls I once caressedAnd may I say, I've held the bestFor helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I knowTo all the girls I've loved beforeThe winds of change are always blowingAnd every time I tried to stayThe winds of change continued blowingAnd they just carried me a wayTo all the girls who shared my lifeWho now are someone else's wifeI'm glad they came alongI dedicate this songTo all the girls I've loved beforeTo all the girls who cared for meWho filled my nights with ecstasyThey live within my heartI'll always be a partOf all the girls I've loved beforeThe winds of change are always blowingAnd every time I tried to stayThe winds of change continued blowingAnd they just carried me wayTo all the girls we've loved beforeWho traveled in and out our doorWe're glad they came alongWe dedicate this songTo all the girls we've loved beforeTo all the girls we've loved beforeWho traveled in and out our doorsWe're glad they came alongWe dedicate this songTo all the girls we've loved, before
