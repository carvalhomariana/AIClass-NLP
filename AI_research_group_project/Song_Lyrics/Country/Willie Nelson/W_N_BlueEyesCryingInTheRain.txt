In the twilight glow I see themBlue eyes cryin' in the rainWhen we kissed goodbye and partedI knew we'd never meet againLove is like a dyin' emberOnly memories remainThrough the ages I'll rememberBlue eyes cryin' in the rainSome day when we meet up yonderWe'll stroll hand in hand againIn a land that knows no partin'Blue eyes cryin' in the rainNow my hair has turned to silverAll my life I've loved in vainI can see her star in heavenBlue eyes crying in the rain
