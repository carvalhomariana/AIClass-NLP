Woah, all I want is on the road againJust can't wait to get on the road againThe life I love is makin' music with my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road againOn the road againJust can't wait to get on the road againThe life I love is makin' music with my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road againOn the road againLike a band of gypsies we go down the highwayWe're the best of friendsInsisting that the world be runnin' our wayAnd our way is on the road againJust can't wait to get on the road againThe life I love is makin' music for my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road againAnd on the road againLike a band of gypsies we go down the highwayWe're the best of friendsInsisting that the world be runnin' our wayAnd our way is on the road againI can't wait to get on the road againThe life I love is makin' music with my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road againI can't wait to get on the road againI can't wait to get on the road
