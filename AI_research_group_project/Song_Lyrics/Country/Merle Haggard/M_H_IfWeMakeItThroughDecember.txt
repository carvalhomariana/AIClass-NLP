If we make it through DecemberEverything's gonna be all right, I knowIt's the coldest time of winterAnd I shiver when I see the falling snowIf we make it through DecemberGot plans to be in a warmer town come summertimeMaybe even CaliforniaIf we make it through December, we'll be fineGot laid off down at the factoryAnd their timing's not the greatest in the worldHeaven knows I been working hardWanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girlI don't mean to hate DecemberIt's meant to be the happy time of yearAnd my little girl don't understandWhy daddy can't afford no Christmas hereIf we make it through DecemberEverything's gonna be all right, I knowIt's the coldest time of winterAnd I shiver when I see the falling snowIf we make it through DecemberGot plans to be in a warmer town come summertimeMaybe even CaliforniaIf we make it through December, we'll be fine
