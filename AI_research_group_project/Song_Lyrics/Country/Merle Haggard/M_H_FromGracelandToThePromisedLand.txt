From the sun years of the Fifties and the birth of rock and rollMillions screamed to see him do his thingElvis touched the life of every ear that heard himAnd they couldn't help but listen when he sangIt's a long way from Memphis to that mansion in the skyBut he kept his faith in Jesus all alongIt's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the Promised LandBut Jesus finally came to lead him home
