Everybody sings the blues sometimesAnd everybody knows the tuneAnd everybody knows the way I'm feelin''Cause everybody's had the bluesA lonely song, someone is gone, a story old as timeLove, hate, or want and wait till misery fills your mindBut everybody knows the way I'm fellin''Cause everybody's had the blues, yes sirA lonely, song someone is gone, a story old as timeLove, hate, or want and wait till misery fills your mindBut everybody knows the way I'm fellin''Cause everybody's had the blues
