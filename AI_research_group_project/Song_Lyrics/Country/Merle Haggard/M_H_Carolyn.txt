Carolyn, let me tell you what I heard about a man todayHe didn't come home from work and he went awayTill he came to a city, bright in the nighttime like dayThere they say he met with some women dressed in yellow and scarletTheir warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honeyAnd somethin' about the smell of strange perfumeMade him feel warm, and not aloneYes, Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his ownAnd sometimes when he's lonelyI believe a man will do that sometimes out of spiteBut Carolyn, a man will do that alwaysWhen he's treated bad at home Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his ownAnd sometimes when he's lonelyAnd I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spiteBut Carolyn, a man will do that alwaysWhen he's treated bad at home
