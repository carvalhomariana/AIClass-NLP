We don't smoke marijuana in MuskogeeWe don't take our trips on LSDWe don't burn our draft cards down on Main StreetWe like livin' right, and bein' freeWe don't make a party out of lovin'We like holdin' hands and pitchin' wooWe don't let our hair grow long and shaggyLike the hippies out in San Francisco doI'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,A place where even squares can have a ballWe still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of allLeather boots are still in style for manly footwearBeads and Roman sandals won't be seenFootball's still the roughest thing on campusAnd the kids here still respect the college deanWAnd I'm proud to be an Okie from MuskogeeA place where even squares can have a ball.We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouseAnd white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of allAnd white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of allIn Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.
