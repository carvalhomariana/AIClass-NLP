I never saw the end in sight; fools are kind of blind.Thought everything was going alright, but I was running out of time.'Cause you had one foot out the door, I swear I didn't seeBut if you're really going away, here's some final words from me.Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down.I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath'Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know,So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your 'frigerator door,Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you'll see it for sure.Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down.You can find a chisel, I can find a stone.Folks will be reading these words, long after we're gone.Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down.Oh I love you and I don't want you to go, baby write this down.
