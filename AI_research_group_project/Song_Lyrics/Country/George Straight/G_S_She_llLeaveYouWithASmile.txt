At first she's gonna come on strongLike she'll love you all night longLike it's going out of styleThen she'll leave you with a smileYou're gonna give her all your heartThen she'll tear your world apartYou're gonna cry a little whileStill she'll leave you with a smileWell, you can't help but wonderWhy you can't help but love herBut you can't help love herAnd all that hurtin' was more than worth itIt's written all over your faceOne day you'll pass her on the streetWith that guy you used to beShe'll say hello and walk on byThen she'll leave you with a smileWell, you can't help but wonderWhy you can't help but love herBut you can't help love herAnd all that hurtin' was more than worth itIt's written all over your faceAt first she's gonna come on strongLike she'll love you all night longLike it's going out of styleThen she'll leave you with a smileAh, she's gonna love youShe gonna leave you with a smileAh, she's gonna love youShe gonna leave you with a smile
