We loaded up my old station wagonWith a tent, Coleman, sleeping bagsSome fishin' poles, a cooler of cokes,Three days before we had to backWhen your seven and your in your seventh heavenGoing campin' in the wild outdoorsAs we turned off on that old dirt road he look at me and sworeDad, this could be the best day of my lifeBeen dreamin' day and night about the fun we'll haveJust me and you doing what I've always wanted toI'm the luckiest boy aliveThis is the best day of my lifeHis fifteenth birthday rolled aroundClassic cars were his thingWhen I pulled in the drive with that old 'vetteI thought that boy would go insaneWhen you're in your teens your dreams revolve around four spinning wheelsWe're not zoned in till it was new againAnd as he sat behind the wheelHe said Dad this could be the best day of my lifeBeen dreamin' day and night about the fun we've hadJust me and you doin' what I've always wanted tooI'm the luckiest boy aroundThis is the best day of my lifeStandin' in the middle of the roomBack of the church with our tuxes onLookin' at him I saidI can't believe son that you've grownHe said dad this could be the best day of my lifeBeen dreamin' day and night About being like youJust me and herWatching you and mom I've learnedI'm the luckiest man aliveThis is the best day of my lifeI'm the luckiest man aliveThis is the best day of my life
