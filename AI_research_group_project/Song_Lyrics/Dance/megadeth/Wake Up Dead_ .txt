"Wake Up Dead"

I sneak in my own house,
It's four in the morning,
I had too much to drink,
Said I was out with the boys,
I creep in my bedroom,
I slip into bed,
I know if I wake her,
I'll wake up dead,

[Chorus:]
I wonder, will she find out,
About the other, other lover,
Diana.

Wake up dead, you die,
Wake up dead, and buried,
Wake up dead, you die,
Wake up dead.
