The sun is settingAnd you're right here by my sideAnd the movie is playingBut we won't be watching tonightEvery look, every touchMakes me wanna give you my heartI'd be crushin' on you, babyStay the way you are'Cause I never knew, I never knewYou could hold moonlight in your hands'Til the night I held youYou're my moonlightMoonlightI kiss his fingertipsAs I'm wishing he's all mineHe's giving me ElvisWith some James Dean in his eyesPuts his lips on my neckMakes me want to give him my bodyI'd be fallin' for you, babyAnd I just can't stop'Cause I never knew, I never knewYou could hold moonlight in your hands'Til the night I held youYou're my moonlightMoonlightBaby, I'd be fallin'You're my moonlightMoonlightHe's so bossyHe makes me danceTryna sit in the back of his whipAnd just cancel my plansSweet like candyBut he's such a manHe knows just what it doesWhen he's holding me tightAnd he calls me "Moonlight" too
